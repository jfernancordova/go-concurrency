## The Account Balance

### The Problem

The primary problem this code addresses is known as a **_"Race Condition."_** In concurrent programming, a race condition occurs when two or more threads or goroutines access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and incorrect results. In this code, multiple goroutines are attempting to modify the `bankBalance` variable concurrently within a loop. This can lead to several issues, including:

- **Data Corruption**: Without proper synchronization, multiple goroutines can read and modify `bankBalance` simultaneously, resulting in incorrect calculations and potentially corrupting the data.
- **Inconsistent Results**: Due to the lack of synchronization, the final `bankBalance` value may vary with each program execution, leading to inconsistent and unpredictable results.
- **Lost Updates**: Simultaneous modifications to `bankBalance` may lead to some updates being lost, resulting in an inaccurate representation of the actual earnings.
- **Race Conditions**: The code may produce race conditions where the order of execution among goroutines affects the final outcome, making it challenging to predict the final `bankBalance.`

### The Solution

The code provides a solution to the synchronization problem by using a Mutex (short for mutual exclusion). A Mutex is a synchronization primitive in Go that allows only one goroutine to access a specific resource at a time, ensuring that concurrent access does not corrupt data or produce unpredictable results.

### Heres how the code solves the problem:

- **Mutex Usage**: It declares a Mutex variable named `balance,` which will protect access to the `bankBalance` variable. The `Lock` and `Unlock` methods of the Mutex ensure that only one goroutine can modify `bankBalance` at a time.
- **Goroutines and Mutex**: Inside the loop that iterates through `incomes,` a goroutine is launched for each `income` source. Each goroutine locks the `balance` Mutex before modifying `bankBalance` and unlocks it after the modification is complete. This ensures that only one goroutine can access `bankBalance` at a time, preventing race conditions.
- **WaitGroup**: The code uses a WaitGroup `(wg)` to wait for all goroutines to finish before printing the final `bankBalance.` The `wg.Add` method increments the WaitGroup counter, and `wg.Done` is called in each goroutine to decrement the counter when they finish.

By using Mutex and the WaitGroup, the code ensures that concurrent access to `bankBalance` is synchronized, preventing race conditions and ensuring accurate and predictable results.

### Conclusion

This Go code demonstrates a common synchronization problem in concurrent programming and provides a solution using `Mutex` and `WaitGroup` to ensure safe access to shared data. Understanding and addressing such synchronization issues is crucial for writing reliable and predictable concurrent programs.
